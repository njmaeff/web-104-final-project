                <h1>Selkirk Web 104 Final Project</h1>

                <p>I made an original mobile web app for tracking jobs roles,
                    successes, and issues. Please use a <strong>mobile
                        viewport</strong> for the best user experience.</p>

                <h2>Design</h2>

                <p>The app has three pages, a login/register page, a getting
                    started page, and an application page. Every menu on the
                    application page has the current employer and current role
                    in the context, so when the user creates entries for
                    performance reviews and self-ratings, they will save under
                    the employer/role.</p>

                <p>The Rocket Ship button on the footer is the edit/save button
                    on each menu. The other icons on the bottom footer are Home
                    Screen, Edit Entries (not implemented yet), Performance
                    Review, and Rate Yourself navigation links.</p>

                <h2>Sources</h2>

                <p>I used a few libraries, including the React framework, for
                    this project. I jumped into React was because I found myself
                    implementing many of the same features which react does so
                    well already, such as reactivity, components, and state
                    management. I appreciate the benefits this framework adds to
                    a project and enables someone to make complex applications
                    quickly.</p>

                <h3>Frameworks</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Libraries</h3>

                <p>I chose a few well-known and supported libraries to
                    fast-track a couple of app features.</p>
                <ul>

                    <li><a
                            href="https://popper.js.org/react-popper/v2/">PopperJS</a>
                        for my drop down menus.</li>

                    <li><a
                            href="https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker">react-datepicker</a>
                        for date time editing.</li>

                    <li><a href="https://formik.org/docs/tutorial">formik</a>
                        for handling forms in a clean way.</li>

                    <li><a
                            href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui">firebaseui</a>
                        for the login UI.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <ul>

                    <li>

                        <p>I created a react-router type library and will
                            migrate it to the actual <a
                                href="https://reactrouter.com/">react-router</a>
                            library as the next phase of the app.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>

                        <p>I also wrote my styles and will migrate to a
                            design/component library in the future, such as <a
                                href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</a>
                            or <a
                                href="https://ant.design/docs/react/getting-started">Ant
                                Design</a>.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>

                        <p>I still have some features to implement, such as
                            editing stored performance reviews and self-rating
                            entries. </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>

                        <p>Extend the form validation, possibly using a library
                            such as <a
                                href="https://github.com/jquense/yup">yup</a>.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>

                        <p>Follow the project on GitHub at <a
                                href="https://github.com/njmaeff/web-104-final-project">https://github.com/njmaeff/web-104-final-project</a>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>

                        <p>Make the project more desktop friendly. The app was
                            designed for mobile use.</p>
                    </li>

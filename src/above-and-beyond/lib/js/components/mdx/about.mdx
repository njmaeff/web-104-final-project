# Selkirk Web 104 Final Project
I made an original mobile web app for tracking jobs roles, successes, and issues. Please use a **mobile viewport** for the best user experience.

## Design
The app has three pages, a login/register page, a getting started page, and an application page. Every menu on the application page has the current employer and current role in the context, so when the user creates entries for performance reviews and self-ratings, they will save under the employer/role.

The Rocket Ship button on the footer is the edit/save button on each menu. The other icons on the bottom footer are Home Screen, Edit Entries (not implemented yet), Performance Review, and Rate Yourself navigation links.

## Sources
I used a few libraries, including the React framework, for this project. I jumped into React was because I found myself implementing many of the same features which react does so well already, such as reactivity, components, and state management. I appreciate the benefits this framework adds to a project and enables someone to make complex applications quickly.

### Frameworks

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

### Libraries
I chose a few well-known and supported libraries to fast-track a couple of app features.

- [PopperJS](https://popper.js.org/react-popper/v2/) for my drop down menus.
- [react-datepicker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker) for date time editing.
- [formik](https://formik.org/docs/tutorial) for handling forms in a clean way.
- [firebaseui](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui) for the login UI.

## Next Steps
- I created a react-router type library and will migrate it to the actual [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) library as the next phase of the app.
- I also wrote my styles and will migrate to a design/component library in the future, such as [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) or [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/getting-started).
- I still have some features to implement, such as editing stored performance reviews and self-rating entries. 
- Extend the form validation, possibly using a library such as [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup).

- Follow the project on GitHub at [https://github.com/njmaeff/web-104-final-project](https://github.com/njmaeff/web-104-final-project)
- Make the project more desktop friendly. The app was designed for mobile use.
